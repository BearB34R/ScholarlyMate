## DUMMY GUIDE TO GITHUB

**if you already know how to use github you can ignore this**
feel free to ask me if you need help clarifying

1. **git pull** //PLEASE do this EVERYTIME BEFORE MERGING, I DON”T WANT TO FIX MERGING CONFLICTS
2. **git branch (your_name)** //This creates your branch
3. **git branch -a** //List out all branches
4. **git checkout (name of whatever branch you want to move to)**
5. **git merge (name of branch you want to merge to the branch you are currently on)**
   - If you want to merge your branch to main/master branch, you have to be on the master branch (check this by doing git status) then do a git merge with the name of the branch you want to merge to the master branch

Starter git commands to know:

- **git status** //good idea to do this before pushing anything or merging
- **git add .** //adds all files to be ready to commit
- **git commit -m “(your comment)”** //comment on your change
- **git push** //pushes your change onto github

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
